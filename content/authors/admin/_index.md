I am Han Jiang, a first year PhD student in computer graphics at the University of Texas at Austin, advised by [Prof. Etienne Vouga](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~evouga/). I had a Bachelor's degree of Computer Science and Mathematics, from the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology. During undergraduate years, I have been supervised by [Prof. Chi-Keung Tang](https://cse.hkust.edu.hk/~cktang/) and [Prof. Yu-Wing Tai](https://yuwingtai.github.io/) on neural radiance fields (NeRF), and [Prof. Craig Schroeder](https://www.cs.ucr.edu/~craigs/) on physics simulation.
