I am Han Jiang, a first year PhD student at the University of Texas at Austin, advised by [Prof. Etienne Vouga](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~evouga/). I have broad research interests in physics simulation (Contact, rigid body, fluids, differentiable simulation, etc.) and its application in optimization, digital humans, generative AI, and more. I obtained my Bachelor's degree of Computer Science and Mathematics, from the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology. During undergraduate years, I have worked with [Prof. Chi-Keung Tang](https://cse.hkust.edu.hk/~cktang/) and [Prof. Yu-Wing Tai](https://yuwingtai.github.io/) on Graphics and 3D Vision (Neural Radiance Fields, Geometric Registration, Diffusion Models), and [Prof. Craig Schroeder](https://www.cs.ucr.edu/~craigs/) on numerical simulation of fluids.
