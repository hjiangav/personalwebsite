I am Han Jiang, a final year undergraduate student at Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, with major in computer science and mathematics. During undergraduate research, I have been supervised by Prof. Chi-Keung Tang and Prof. Yu-Wing Tai on neural radiance fields (NeRF), and Prof. Craig Schroeder on physics simulation. My research interest is on Physics-based Animation, including (1) numerical computation and computational physics, and (2) AI and machine learning for simulation.
